            <h1>Glute Gains: The Complete Guide to Building a Stronger, Bigger Butt</h1>
            <p class="meta">February 26, 2026 • 8 min read</p>
            
            <p class="lead">You've been squatting for months. Maybe years. But your glutes still look the same. Sound familiar?</p>

            <p>The truth is, building glutes isn't just about squatting. It's about understanding muscle anatomy, training smart, feeding your muscles, and avoiding the mistakes that are holding you back.</p>

            <p>This guide covers everything you need to know to build the glutes you've always wanted.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Your Glutes</h2>
            <p>Your glutes aren't just one muscle—they're three:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gluteus Maximus</strong> – The largest, responsible for hip extension and the shape you see</li>
                <li><strong>Gluteus Medius</strong> – Side glute, stabilizes hips and pelvis</li>
                <li><strong>Gluteus Minimus</strong> – Smallest, assists with hip abduction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To build full, round glutes, you need to train all three. That's why doing only squats often isn't enough.</p>

            <h2>The Best Exercises for Glute Growth</h2>

            <h3>1. Hip Thrusts (The King)</h3>
            <p>Hip thrusts are the most effective glute exercise. They provide maximum glute activation while allowing heavy loading. Keep your back against a bench, feet flat, and thrust your hips up until your body forms a straight line from knees to shoulders.</p>

            <h3>2. Bulgarian Split Squats</h3>
            <p>Single-leg exercise that torches glutes while improving balance. Front foot elevated, back foot on bench, lower until front thigh is parallel to the ground.</p>

            <h3>3. Romanian Deadlifts</h3>
            <p>Targets the glutes and hamstrings through hip hinge movement. Keep the bar close, hinge at the hips, and feel the stretch in your glutes.</p>

            <h3>4. Glute Bridges</h3>
            <p>Great for beginners and can be progressed with weight. Squeeze your glutes at the top and hold for 2 seconds.</p>

            <h3>5. Cable Kickbacks</h3>
            <p>Isolation exercise that really burns out the glutes. Attach an ankle strap and kick back with control.</p>

            <h2>The Glute Training Formula</h2>
            <p>For maximum growth, follow this framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Train glutes 2-3 times per week</li>
                <li><strong>Volume:</strong> 10-20 sets per week</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive overload:</strong> Add weight or reps every week</li>
                <li><strong>Mind-muscle connection:</strong> Focus on squeezing your glutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Mistakes Killing Your Gains</h2>

            <h3>Mistake #1: Too Much Quad-Dominant Work</h3>
            <p>If your quads are taking over in squats, you're not targeting your glutes. Switch to hip thrusts or Bulgarian split squats.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #2: Not Going Heavy Enough</h3>
            <p>Glutes are the largest muscle in your body. They need heavy stimulation to grow. Add weight when you can do 12+ reps easily.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #3: No Mind-Muscle Connection</h3>
            <p>You're just going through the motions. Focus on squeezing your glutes at the top of each rep.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #4: Neglecting The Pump</h3>
            <p>Don't skip high-rep sets. They create the metabolic stress that drives growth.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #5: Bad Form</h3>
            <p>Cutting ranges of motion short? Letting your lower back arch? Fix your form or you'll both limit gains and risk injury.</p>

            <h2>Nutrition for Glute Growth</h2>
            <p>You can't out-train a bad diet. Here's what matters:</p>

            <h3>Protein</h3>
            <p>Aim for 0.7-1g per pound of body weight daily. Your glutes need protein to rebuild and grow.</p>

            <h3>Calories</h3>
            <p>To build muscle, you need a surplus. Eat 200-300 calories above maintenance.</p>

            <h3>Carbs</h3>
            <p>Glutes are energy-demanding. Don't fear carbs—they fuel your workouts and help with recovery.</p>

            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>Muscle growth happens during sleep. Get 7-9 hours per night.</p>

            <h2>The 12-Week Glute Transformation Plan</h2>
            <p>Here's a sample weekly schedule:</p>

            <h3>Week 1-4: Foundation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Day 1: Hip thrusts, glute bridges, cable kickbacks</li>
                <li>Day 2: Rest</li>
                <li>Day 3: Bulgarian split squats, RDLs, lunges</li>
                <li>Day 4: Rest</li>
                <li>Day 5: Hip thrusts, glute bridges, walkouts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 5-8: Growth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase weight by 5-10%</li>
                <li>Add drop sets</li>
                <li>Add 1 extra set per exercise</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 9-12: Max</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Push for new PRs</li>
                <li>Add intensity techniques</li>
                <li>Deload week 12</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Turn</h2>
            <p>Building glutes takes time. Expect to see changes in 8-12 weeks. Stay consistent, eat right, and trust the process.</p>

            <p>The glutes you want are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen. Commit to both.</p>
