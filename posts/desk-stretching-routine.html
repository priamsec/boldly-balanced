            <h1>Desk Stretching Routine: Quick Relief for Office Workers</h1>
            <p class="meta">February 22, 2026 • 5 min read</p>
            
            <p>Hours of sitting at a desk takes a toll on your body. Tight hips, sore neck, lower back pain—these are the hallmarks of desk life. This quick stretching routine can help counteract the damage.</p>

            <h2>Why Stretching Matters for Desk Workers</h2>
            <p>Sitting for extended periods causes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tight hip flexors from prolonged sitting</li>
                <li>Rounded shoulders from looking at screens</li>
                <li>Neck strain from forward head posture</li>
                <li>Lower back discomfort from poor sitting posture</li>
                <li>Reduced blood flow and stiffness</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Regular stretching counteracts these effects, improves posture, reduces pain, and boosts circulation and focus.</p>

            <h2>The 5-Minute Desk Stretching Routine</h2>
            <p>Do this routine every 2-3 hours or whenever you feel tight. No special equipment needed.</p>

            <h3>1. Neck Rolls (30 seconds)</h3>
            <p>Slowly drop your chin to your chest. Roll your head to the right, bringing your ear toward your shoulder. Continue rolling your head back, then to the left. Complete 5 rolls in each direction.</p>
            <p><em>Relieves: Neck tension, cervicogenic headaches</em></p>

            <h3>2. Shoulder Shrugs and Rolls (30 seconds)</h3>
            <p>Raise your shoulders toward your ears, hold for 2 seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times. Then roll shoulders forward 10 times, then backward 10 times.</p>
            <p><em>Relieves: Upper back tension, shoulder stiffness</em></p>

            <h3>3. Chest Opener (30 seconds)</h3>
            <p>Clasp your hands behind your back. Straighten arms and lift them slightly while squeezing your shoulder blades together. Look up slightly and hold.</p>
            <p><em>Relieves: Rounded shoulders, chest tightness</em></p>

            <h3>4. Seated Spinal Twist (30 seconds each side)</h3>
            <p>Sit up tall in your chair. Place your right hand on your left knee and gently twist to the left. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.</p>
            <p><em>Relieves: Lower back tension, improves spinal mobility</em></p>

            <h3>5. Hip Flexor Stretch (30 seconds each side)</h3>
            <p>Move to the edge of your chair. Extend your right leg behind you, keeping your left foot flat on the floor. Tuck your pelvis under and lean slightly forward. Hold, then switch sides.</p>
            <p><em>Relieves: Tight hip flexors, lower back pain</em></p>

            <h3>6. Seated Figure-Four Stretch (30 seconds each side)</h3>
            <p>Cross your right ankle over your left knee (figure-four position). Keep your right foot flexed. Gently press down on your right knee until you feel a stretch in your right hip. Hold, then switch sides.</p>
            <p><em>Relieves: Tight hips, piriformis tension</em></p>

            <h3>7. Wrist Circles (30 seconds)</h3>
            <p>Extend your arms in front of you. Make fists and rotate your wrists in circles—10 times in each direction. Then spread fingers wide and make circles the other direction.</p>
            <p><em>Relieves: Wrist stiffness, typing tension</em></p>

            <h2>Additional Tips for Desk Workers</h2>
            
            <h3>Posture Reminders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep feet flat on the floor</li>
                <li>Monitor at eye level</li>
                <li>Shoulders back and relaxed</li>
                <li>Support lower back with chair lumbar support</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movement Breaks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stand up every 30-60 minutes</li>
                <li>Take a short walk to the bathroom or water fountain</li>
                <li>Do a quick lap around the office</li>
                <li>Use the stairs when possible</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Desk Setup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chair height: feet flat, thighs parallel to floor</li>
                <li>Keyboard: elbows at 90 degrees</li>
                <li>Monitor: arm's length away, top at eye level</li>
                <li>Consider a standing desk or sitting-stand alternation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sample Stretching Schedule</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>9:00 AM:</strong> Neck rolls, shoulder shrugs</li>
                <li><strong>11:00 AM:</strong> Full 5-minute routine</li>
                <li><strong>1:00 PM:</strong> Hip flexor stretch, spinal twist (after lunch)</li>
                <li><strong>3:00 PM:</strong> Full 5-minute routine</li>
                <li><strong>5:00 PM:</strong> Chest opener, shoulder rolls</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The key is consistency. These small movements add up to big improvements in how you feel. Set a timer to remind yourself, and make stretching as routine as checking your email.</p>
