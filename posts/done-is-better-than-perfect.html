            <h1>Done Is Better Than Perfect: Start Before You're Ready</h1>
            <p class="meta">February 26, 2026 • 4 min read</p>
            
            <p>You know that project sitting in your drafts? That business idea you keep "researching"? That book you want to write?</p>

            <p>Here's the truth nobody tells you: you'll never feel ready. Ever.</p>

            <p>The perfect moment doesn't exist. The perfect plan is a myth. And the version of yourself that "has it all figured out"? She's not coming. She's not waiting in some future where you've finally done enough preparation.</p>

            <p>She's waiting right now—inside the messy, imperfect version of you that's willing to start.</p>

            <h2>The Perfectionism Trap</h2>
            <p>Perfectionism feels like high standards. It masquerades as caring about quality. But underneath? It's fear dressed up as discipline.</p>

            <p>You're not waiting to launch because it won't be perfect. You're waiting because you're terrified of putting something out there that isn't flawless. Because then—god forbid—someone might see you. The real you. The imperfect you.</p>

            <p>But here's what perfectionism actually costs you: everything.</p>

            <h2>What "Ready" Actually Means</h2>
            <p>When you say "I'm not ready," what you really mean is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I'm scared</strong></li>
                <li><strong>I don't want to fail</strong></li>
                <li><strong>I want guarantees first</strong></li>
                <li><strong>I want to control the outcome</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>None of those are "ready." They're all just fear wearing different masks.</p>

            <h2>The Secret No One Tells You</h2>
            <p>Done > Perfect. Not sometimes. Not "when conditions are right." Always.</p>

            <p>Because when you finish something—even something flawed—you gain three things perfection can never give you:</p>

            <h3>1. Momentum</h3>
            <p>A finished mediocre project creates more energy than a perfect idea sitting in your head. Movement breeds more movement. Done is fuel.</p>

            <h3>2. Feedback</h3>
            <p>You can't improve what you haven't released. Perfect work in a drawer teaches you nothing. Done work in the world teaches you everything.</p>

            <h3>3. Identity</h3>
            <p>Every time you finish something—even imperfect—you prove to yourself that you're someone who finishes. That identity compounds. One done thing makes the next one easier.</p>

            <h2>How to Start Before You're Ready</h2>

            <h3>Set a Deadline, Not a Standard</h3>
            <p>Instead of "make it perfect," try "finish by Tuesday." Constraints force progress. Ambiguous standards force procrastination.</p>

            <h3>Give Yourself Permission to Start Ugly</h3>
            <p>Your first draft is supposed to be bad. That's the point. A bad first draft is infinitely better than a perfect idea that never becomes a draft.</p>

            <h3>Launch in Public, Not in Private</h3>
            <p>Telling someone your deadline creates accountability. Share your work before you're comfortable. Comfort is overrated.</p>

            <h3>Reframe "Failure"</h3>
            <p>What's the worst that happens? It doesn't work? You learn something? You adjust? That's not failure. That's data.</p>

            <h2>The Real Cost of Waiting</h2>
            <p>Every day you wait, you're not protecting yourself from failure. You're robbing yourself of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The skills you'd gain from doing</li>
                <li>The connections you'd make from sharing</li>
                <li>The person you'd become from finishing</li>
                <li>The momentum that changes everything</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You're not behind. But you will be—if you keep waiting for a readiness that isn't coming.</p>

            <h2>Start Now</h2>
            <p>Whatever you've been putting off: do one imperfect thing toward it today. One messy, incomplete, "not-ready" thing.</p>

            <p>Hit publish. Send the email. Post the content. Launch the thing. Make the call.</p>

            <p>Done beats perfect. Always. Start before you're ready—especially when you're not ready. That's when it matters most.</p>
