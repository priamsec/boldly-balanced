            <h1>Best Supplements for Longevity in 2026</h1>

            <p>The supplement industry is full of hype. Here's what actually has science behind it for longevity and healthy aging.</p>

            <h2>1. Vitamin D3</h2>
            <p>Essential for immune function, bone health, and potentially longevity. Most people are deficient, especially in winter. <strong>Dosage:</strong> 2000-4000 IU daily (get levels tested).</p>

            <h2>2. Omega-3 Fish Oil</h2>
            <p>EPA and DHA support heart health, brain function, and reduce inflammation. Look for high-EPA formulations. <strong>Dosage:</strong> 2-3g combined EPA/DHA daily.</p>
            <p><em>Affiliate pick: Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega</em></p>

            <h2>3. Magnesium</h2>
            <p>Supports sleep, muscle function, and hundreds of enzymatic reactions. Many people are deficient. <strong>Dosage:</strong> 200-400mg magnesium glycinate or citrate at night.</p>

            <h2>4. NAD+ Precursors (NMN/NR)</h2>
            <p>NAD+ declines with age. Precursors like NMN and NR may support cellular energy. Evidence is promising but still emerging. <strong>Dosage:</strong> 250-500mg NMN daily.</p>

            <h2>5. Spermidine</h2>
            <p>May support autophagy (cellular cleanup). Found in wheat germ, but supplements are convenient. <strong>Dosage:</strong> 5-10mg daily.</p>

            <h2>6. CoQ10</h2>
            <p>Essential for mitochondrial energy production. Levels decline after 40. <strong>Dosage:</strong> 100-200mg ubiquinol (the reduced form) daily.</p>

            <h2>7. Vitamin K2</h2>
            <p>Works with Vitamin D for bone and heart health. <strong>Dosage:</strong> 100-200mcg MK-7 form daily.</p>

            <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Most "longevity" blends with proprietary blends (you don't know dosages)</li>
                <li>High-dose single nutrients unless deficient</li>
                <li>Anything promising "reverse aging"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>Start with the basics: Vitamin D, Omega-3, Magnesium. Then consider the more advanced options based on your budget and goals.</p>
            <p><strong>Always consult a healthcare provider before starting supplements, especially if you have health conditions or take medications.</strong></p>
