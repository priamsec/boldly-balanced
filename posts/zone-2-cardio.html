            <p>Zone 2 training is the secret weapon of elite athletes and longevity enthusiasts alike. Here's why training at low intensity might be the best thing you do for your health.</p>

            <h2>What is Zone 2?</h2>
            <p>Zone 2 refers to a specific heart rate intensity zone—typically 60-70% of your maximum heart rate. At this level, your body primarily uses fat as fuel and produces energy aerobically (with oxygen). You can hold a conversation, but you're breathing heavier than normal.</p>

            <p>To find your Zone 2:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Max HR method:</strong> 220 - your age = max HR. Zone 2 = 60-70% of that number</li>
                <li><strong>Talk test:</strong> You can speak in full sentences, but not sing</li>
                <li><strong>Rate of perceived exertion:</strong> 4-5 out of 10</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Benefits</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Mitochondrial Health</h3>
            <p>Zone 2 training dramatically improves your mitochondria—the powerhouses of your cells. More mitochondria means more energy production, better aging, and improved metabolic health.</p>

            <h3>2. Fat Adaptation</h3>
            <p>Your body becomes better at burning fat for fuel. This improves body composition and provides a steady energy source during longer activities.</p>

            <h3>3. Cardiovascular Base</h3>
            <p>Building a strong aerobic base reduces resting heart rate, improves stroke volume (blood pumped per beat), and lowers risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>

            <h3>4. Recovery</h3>
            <p>Zone 2 is gentle enough for active recovery days. It increases blood flow without adding stress to your nervous system.</p>

            <h3>5. Longevity</h3>
            <p>Research shows that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is one of the strongest predictors of longevity. Zone 2 delivers these benefits with lower injury risk than high-intensity training.</p>

            <h2>How to Train Zone 2</h2>
            
            <h3>Activities That Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brisk walking</li>
                <li>Light cycling</li>
                <li>Swimming at a moderate pace</li>
                <li>Elliptical or rowing machine (easy pace)</li>
                <li>Hiking</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Duration and Frequency</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with:</strong> 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times per week</li>
                <li><strong>Build up to:</strong> 45-90 minutes, 4-5 times per week</li>
                <li><strong>Key:</strong> Consistency over intensity</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Going too hard:</strong> If you can't talk comfortably, you're in Zone 3 or higher</li>
                <li><strong>Skipping the warm-up:</strong> It takes 10-15 minutes to truly settle into Zone 2</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Zone 2 benefits come from regular, sustained practice</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Equipment for Zone 2 Training</h2>
            <p>You don't need much, but a heart rate monitor helps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heart Rate Monitor</strong> – Polar, Whoop, or Garmin</li>
                <li><strong>Chest Strap</strong> – For accurate readings</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Watch</strong> – Apple Watch or Garmin</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sample Week</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday:</strong> 30 min Zone 2 walk or bike</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Rest or light stretching</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> 45 min Zone 2 swim</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> 30 min Zone 2 hike</li>
                <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Rest</li>
                <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> 60 min Zone 2 cycling</li>
                <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> 30 min easy walk</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The magic of Zone 2 is its simplicity. You don't need fancy equipment or intense effort—just consistency and patience. Start where you are, build gradually, and watch your aerobic fitness transform.</p>
